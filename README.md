## 🤖 Available Bots

The following AI bots are included in the game:

| Bot          | Strategy Description                                           |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `RandomBot`  | Chooses directions randomly                                    |
| `GreedyBot`  | Moves toward the nearest food                                  |
| `StrategicBot` | Avoids traps, considers opponent position, seeks survival     |
| `CustomBot`  | Placeholder for your own custom logic                          |
| `UserBot`    | Allows human input (currently not active by default)          |

To change the bots used in the game, modify the following lines in `main.py` (or wherever `SnakeGame` is initialized):

```python
self.bot1 = StrategicBot()
self.bot2 = GreedyBot()
# self.user_bot = UserBot()
```

## ⚙️ Game Settings

You can tweak gameplay settings in `game_settings.py`, such as:

- `Segment_Penalty` 
- `round_time`
- `trap_count`
- `growth_per_food`
- `Colors`, `fonts`, and more

## 🧠 Tournament Logic

- A match consists of multiple rounds.
- If both bots tie in win count, a **tiebreaker round** is triggered.
- Each round can be won by:
  - Outlasting the opponent
  - Scoring more points (by collecting food)
- Special logic ensures fairness with timed **"survival advantage"** if one bot dies first due to self-collision.

**Example:**

```python
class UserBot(Bot):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.name = "MyBot"
    
    def decide_move(self, snake, food, opponent=None):
        # Implement your custom logic here
